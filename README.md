Youtube Downloader WebUI

I tried to Create a youtube-download website for sending music and videos directly to a Folder on your server, it also provides an automatic download button and i tried to write enough comment, that everyone is able to fix it on his own if there is an error.

I'm Sorry the code is realy ugly written and shouldn't be used for any Critical data, it's easy to send in direct shellcode which gets executed by the Server.
I just want this for my emby server on my raspberry to add new songs and Videos.
